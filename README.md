# speed-reading-metronome

A metronome for speed reading that emits a discrete reminder to turn the page.

# Why?

I do a *lot* of reading, but I often find myself reading "slowly" ...
For example I might read 20 pages per hour of a non-fiction book,
i.e. 3 minutes per page (_average_).
I think I can do better with a simple nudge of a "metronome".
