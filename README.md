# Speed Reading Metronome

A metronome for speed reading that emits a discrete reminder to turn the page.
A gentle nudge that progressively improves reading speed over time
so that I/we can read all the books on my/our "to read" list at a steady pace.


# Why?

As a person on a perpetual life learning & knowledge quest,
I do a *lot* of reading every day.
I read a _minimum_ of **1 hour** each morning.
With this _daily_ habit I have managed to read
a couple of _thousand_ books in the last 20 years.

I read an _average_ of **1 book per week** year round.
This might sound like a little or a _lot_
depending on your own reading practice and ambitions.

Sometimes I read several books a week (e.g: during the summer),
but others I go down to 1 every 2 weeks when I'm particularly busy.

On Some days I read for 3 hours because I get immersed in the book,
but I often find myself reading "slowly" ...
For example I might read **20 pages per hour** of a non-fiction book,
i.e. 3 pages minutes per page (_average_).
I _know_ I can read **_much_ faster** than this,
because during University, I trained myself to speed-read
in order to consume all the material necessary
for the literature review in my masters thesis.

At the time I figured that the most effective way to get through the _stack_
I had to read, was to learn how to speed-read.
I spent a week learning to speed-read from scratch
and then devoured tens of thousands of pages of books and journal articles
in the subsequent weeks; it was a highly worthwhile effort!

Sadly, my reading speed has declined over the past few years,
possibly due to chronic insomnia/tiredness, but for whatever reason,
I find myself not getting through the books nearly as fast as I used to!

My _hypothesis_ for this mini-project is that
I can "nudge" myself to read faster,
with a simple reading "metronome"
to remind me to turn the page.

> I might _instantly_ get sick of the sound,
but I want to _experiment_ with it and see if I can make it work!

# What?

A mini project to emit a "page turn" sound every minute (_or set time interval_)

## Doesn't This _Already_ Exist...?

As usual, when thinking about how to _solve_ a problem,
our _first_ instinct is to search on Google<sup>1</sup> for
the keywords we think are most likely to give us a result: <br />
"**reading metronome**": https://www.google.com/search?q=reading+metronome

As you can see, we clicked and read _every_ link to figure out if
anyone **`else`** has _already_ built this!

We also searched the iOS App Store and Google Play
and didn't find anything matching "reading metronome".

## Elm?

I could _easily_ solve this in _minutes_ using **JavaScript**
(_the language I've written most in the last 10 years_)
but in _forcing_ myself to use Elm (_instead of reaching for my
  ["hammer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument ..._),
I develop the muscle memory in the skill I want to _focus_ on.


# Who?

This project is for [me](https://github.com/nelsonic);
I am the "target user".
I'm ["**scratching my _own_ itch**"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scratch_one%27s_own_itch).
Ensuring the _tightest_ possible **feedback loop**.

I'm writing _publishing_ it as an _example_
of _why_ learning to _code_
is a worthwhile _personal_ investment.
It means you can _solve_ your own problems/challenges!
The fact that you can get _paid_ to write code
which in turn enables you to do
[_many_ other things](https://github.com/dwyl/home)
with your life is a _bonus_, not the _focus_.

## Pre-requisites?

The only pre-requisites for following this example are:
+ [x] A Computer where you can install Elm
+ [x] Basic Elm syntax knowledge e.g: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elm
(_you don't need any "advanced" Elm/Programming knowledge, just syntax_)
+ [x] 30 minutes of time to read & and try the code.
